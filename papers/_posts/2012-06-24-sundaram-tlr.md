# Abstract 

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a crucial role in host defence, since they trigger immune response following recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in potential infectious agents. TLRs have been found in numerous organisms, including mammals, birds and teleosts. Some TLR members are commonly retained across all species, whilst others were lost, gained or diverged independently during evolution. Our knowledge about the evolution and specific functions of _tlr21_, _tlr22_ and _tlr23_ in teleosts are still scarce. Phylogenetic analysis of 18 _tlr13_, _tlr21_, _tlr22_ and _tlr23_ genes from 9 different fish species divided them in two groups. All _tlr21_ genes were under the first clade, while the second comprised _tlr22_, _tlr23_ and _tlr13_ from Atlantic salmon. Evidence of positive selection was detected at three sites within the leucine-rich repeat regions of Tlr22, which may influence PAMP recognition. Immunostimulation experiments revealed that expression of zebrafish _tlr22_ is modulated by several unrelated PAMPs. Up to a 3-fold increase in _tlr21_ and _tlr22_ expression was detected in larvae exposed to immunostimulants such as lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan or poly I:C. We found that zebrafish _tlr_s are expressed mainly in immune-related organs, such as spleen and kidney as well as in testis and temperature stress did not have an effect on the expression of _tlr21_ and _tlr22_ in the early stages of development in zebrafish larvae. Our data indicates that these teleost _tlr_s may play a role in innate host defence. In particular, _tlr22_ is evolving under positive selection, which indicates functional diversification and adaptation of the response to different PAMPs.
