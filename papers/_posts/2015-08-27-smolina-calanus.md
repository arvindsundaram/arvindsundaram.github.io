# Abstract 

Climate change has already led to the range expansion of warm-water plankton assemblages in the northeast Atlantic and the corresponding range contraction of colder-water species. The temperate copepod <emb>Calanus finmarchicus</emb> is predicted to shift farther northward into polar waters traditionally dominated by the arctic copepod <emb>C. glacialis</emb>. To identify temperature-mediated changes in gene expression that may be critical for the thermal acclimation and resilience of the 2 <emb>Calanus</emb> spp., we conducted a whole transcriptome profiling using RNA-seq on an Ion Torrent platform. Transcriptome responses of <emb>C. finmarchicus</emb> and <emb>C. glacialis</emb> from Disko Bay, west Greenland, were investigated under realistic thermal stresses (at +5, +10 and +15°C) for 4 h and 6 d. <emb>C. finmarchicus</emb> showed a strong response to temperature and duration of stress, involving up-regulation of genes related to protein folding, transcription, translation and metabolism. In sharp contrast, <emb>C. glacialis</emb> displayed only low-magnitude changes in gene expression in response to temperature and duration of stress. Differences in the thermal responses of the 2 species, particularly the lack of thermal stress response in <emb>C. glacialis</emb>, are in line with laboratory and field observations and suggest a vulnerability of <emb>C. glacialis</emb> to climate change.
